## Preprocessed data
1. dupl_mean_dist.rds : RDS file to be opened in R, containing the GSEA distances (see overview page with references) between a subset of data that have duplicate signatures.
2. FilteredOmnipath.tsv: Text file (tsv format) containing the interactions of the OmniPath resource used to see if we can access STAT3 from another gene via a signalling cascade.
Duplicate signatures are samples that are derived by testing the same drug on the same cell-type,with same dose and for the same treatment duration.
