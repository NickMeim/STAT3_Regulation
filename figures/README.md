## Produced figures of the study
Here we have stored the figures and the scripts that produce them:
1. duplicatesDistributionPlot.R : It plots the distribution of gene expression (GSEA) distances (see overview and code in pre-processing for explanation) between the duplicate signatures and random signatures.
Duplicate signatures are experiments in which the same drug was tested on the same cell-type, with the same dose and for the same time duration.
